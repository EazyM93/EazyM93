**`Full-stack Developrer`**

I am a junior Full-Stack Developer building my new professional life with consistency, diligence and determination.
I completed a six-month intensive course at Epicode School After in September 2023, after working years in kitchens as a chef. I get back on code and decide to start a professional carrier in tech. I am a passionate good worker in love with ${\color{aqua}Back-end}$ and want to grow as developer, starting beautiful project from 0 and building them the best way possible.
